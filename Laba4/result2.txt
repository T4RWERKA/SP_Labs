And what I assume you shall assume,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
Hoping to cease not till death.
I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
I loafe and invite my soul,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
My tongue, every atom of my blood, formâ€™d from this soil, this air,
